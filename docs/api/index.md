## Function Naming Conventions

ScheduleLua follows consistent naming conventions to make the API intuitive:

- `Get*` - Functions that retrieve data (e.g., `GetPlayerPosition`, `GetGameTime`)
- `Set*` - Functions that modify data (e.g., `SetPlayerHealth`, `SetNPCPosition`)
- `Find*` - Functions that search for specific entities (e.g., `FindNPC`, `FindGameObject`)
- `Is*` - Functions that return boolean values (e.g., `IsNightTime`, `IsNPCInRegion`)
- `Register*` - Functions that register callbacks or commands (e.g., `RegisterCommand`)
- `Unregister*` - Functions that remove registered callbacks or commands (e.g., `UnregisterCommand`)
- `On*` - Callback functions triggered by specific events (e.g., `OnPlayerReady`, `OnDayChanged`)

## Function Documentation Format

Each function in the API is documented with the following information:

- **Signature**: The function's parameter types and return value
- **Implementation Status**: Current development status (stable, experimental, planned)
- **Description**: What the function does
- **Parameters**: Details about each parameter
- **Returns**: Description of what the function returns
- **Examples**: Code examples showing how to use the function
- **Notes**: Additional information, limitations, and best practices

## Script Lifecycle Hooks

Your Lua scripts can implement several lifecycle hooks that are called at specific points during execution:

| Hook | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `Initialize()` | ✅ Stable | Called when the script is first loaded |
| `Update()` | ✅ Stable | Called every frame |
| `OnConsoleReady()` | ✅ Stable | Called when the console is loaded and ready |
| `OnPlayerReady()` | ✅ Stable | Called when the player is loaded and ready |
| `OnSceneLoaded(sceneName)` | ✅ Stable | Called when a new scene is loaded |
| `OnDayChanged(day)` | 🔄 Partial | Called when the game day changes |
| `OnTimeChanged(time)` | 🔄 Partial | Called when the game time changes |
| `OnPlayerHealthChanged(newHealth)` | 🔄 Partial | Called when player health changes |
| `OnPlayerEnergyChanged(newEnergy)` | 🔄 Partial | Called when player energy changes |
| `Shutdown()` | ✅ Stable | Called when the script is unloaded |
